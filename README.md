# Advanced Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves advanced data analysis techniques to explore, clean, and visualize datasets. The objective is to gain insights and make data-driven decisions based on the analysis.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), which provides a comprehensive set of data related to various aspects of the city's operations.
